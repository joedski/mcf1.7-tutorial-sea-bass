# Tutorial Mod from Sea Bass' Tutorial
## Modding Minecraft 1.7 with Forge

[Here is Sea Bass' tutorial on how to add a new block, a new item, and a new entity with AI.](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2389683-172-forge-add-new-block-item-entity-ai-creative-tab-language-localization-block-textures-side-textures/)

There are/will be tags you can use to quickly and easily jump to various points in the tutorial history, since looking at the differences/diffs between files is easier than trying to find them yourself.  That's why we have computers, anyway.

As of writing, tags are:
* *1-block-texture* - A new mod with a single block inserted into a new Creative tab.  The block has a texture, too.

More will be added as progress through the tutorial is made.

## Stop Reading Here

Yes, I cuddle all the braces.  I might change that in future projects to match the Forge style more closely maybe.  Maybe not.

There's a probably badly done Norwegian Bokmål localization because av læring dårlig norsk.
